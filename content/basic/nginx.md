At this point, we should have a domain name and a server and the domain
name should direct to the IP address of the server with DNS records. As
I said in previous articles, the instructions I will give will be for
**Debian**. In this article, other distributions might work a little
differently.

## Logging in to the server

We first want to log into our VPS to get a command prompt where we can
set up the web server. I am assuming you are using either MacOS or
GNU/Linux and you know how to open a terminal. On Windows, you can also
use either PuTTY or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Now on Vultr\'s site, you can click on your VPS and you will see that
there is an area that shows you the password for your server at the
bottom here.

{{< img alt="Find your password" src="/pix/nginx-password.png" link="/pix/nginx-password.png" >}}

Now pull up a terminal and type:

```sh
ssh root@example.org
```

This command will attempt to log into your server. It should prompt you
for your password, and you can just copy or type in the password from
Vultr\'s site.

If you get an error here, you might not have done your [DNS
settings](dns.html) right. Double check those. Note you can also replace
the `example.org` with your IP address, but you\'ll want to fix your DNS
settings soon.

## Installing the Webserver: Nginx

If the program runs without an error, `ssh` has now logged you into your
server. Let\'s start by running the following commands.

```sh
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install nginx
```

The first command checks for packages that can be updated and the second
command installs any updates.

The third command installs `nginx` (pronounced Engine-X) which is the
web server we\'ll be using, along with some other programs.

### Our nginx configuration file

`nginx` is your webserver. You can make a little website or page, put it
on your VPS and then tell `nginx` where it is and how to host it on the
internet. It\'s simple. Let\'s do it.

`nginx` configuration files are in `/etc/nginx/`. The two main
subdirectories in there (on Debian and similar OSes) are
`/etc/nginx/sites-available` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. The names
are descriptive. The idea is that you can make a site configuration file
in `sites-available` and when it\'s all ready, you make a link/shortcut
to it in `sites-enabled` which will activate it.

First, let\'s create the settings for our website. You can copy and
paste (with required changes) but I will also explain what the lines do.

Create a file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` by doing this:

```sh
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite
```

Note that \"nano\" is a command line text editor. You will now be able
to create and edit this file. By saving, this file will now appear. Note
also I name the file `mywebsite`, but you can name it whatever you\'d
like.

I\'m going to add the following content to the file. The content **like
this** will be different depending on what you want to call your site.

```nginx
server {
        listen 80 ;
        listen [::]:80 ;
        server_name landchad.net ;
        root /var/www/landchad ;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html ;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404 ;
        }
}
```

#### Explanation of those settings

The `listen` lines tell `nginx` to listen for connections on both IPv4
and IPv6.

The `server_name` is the website that we are looking for. By putting
`landchad.net` here, that means whenever someone connects to this server
and is looking for that address, they will be directed to the content in
this block.

`root` specifies the directory we\'re going to put our website files in.
This can theoretically be wherever, but it is conventional to have them
in `/var/www/`. Name the directory in that whatever you want.

`index` determine what the \"default\" file is; normally when you go to
a website, say `landchad.net`, you are actually going to a file at
`landchad.net/index.html`. That\'s all that is. Note that that this in
concert with the line above mean that `/var/www/landchad/index.html`, a
file on our computer that we\'ll create will be the main page of our
website.

Lastly, the `location` block is really just telling the server how to
look up files, otherwise throw a 404 error. Location settings are very
powerful, but this is all we need them for now.

### Create the directory and index for the site

We\'ll actually start making a \"real\" website later, but let\'s go
ahead and create a little page that will appear on when someone looks up
the domain.

```sh
mkdir /var/www/landchad
```

Now let\'s create and index file inside of that directory which will
appear when the website is accessed:

```sh
nano /var/www/landchad/index.html
```

I\'ll add the following basic content, but you can add whatever you
want. This will appear on your website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>My website!</h1>
<p>This is my website. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>Now my website is live!</p>
```

### Enable the site {#enable}

Once you save that file, we can enable it making a link to it in the
`sites-enabled` directory:

```sh
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsite /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

Now we can just `reload` or `restart` to make `nginx` service the new
configuration:

```sh
systemctl reload nginx
```

## The Firewall {#firewall}

Vultr and some other VPS automatically install and enable `ufw`, a
firewall program. This will block basically everything by default, so we
have to change that. If you don\'t have `ufw` installed, you can skip
this section.

We must open up at least ports 80 and 443 as below:

```sh
ufw allow 80
ufw allow 443
```

Port 80 is the canonical webserver port, while 443 is the port used for
encrypted connections. We will certainly need that for the next page.

<aside>

As you add more services to your website, they might need you to open more ports, but that will be mentioned on individual articles.
(It should be noted that some local services only running for other services on your machine, so you *don't* need to open ports for every process running locally, *only* those that directly interact with the internet, although it's common to run those through NginX for simplicity and security.)

</aside>

## Nginx security hint

By default, Nginx and most other webservers automatically show their
version number on error pages. It\'s a good idea to disable this from
happening because if an exploit comes out for your server software,
someone could exploit it. Open the main Nginx config file
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and find the line `# server_tokens off;`.
Uncomment it, and reload Nginx.

Remember to [keep your server software up to
date](maintenance.html#update) to get the latest security fixes!

## We now have running website!

At this point you can now type in your website in your browser and this
webpage will appear!

{{< img alt="The webpage as it appears." src="/pix/nginx-website.png" link="/pix/nginx-website.png" >}}

Note the \"Not secure\" notification. The next brief step is securing
encrypted connections to your website.
