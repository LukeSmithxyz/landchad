    <header><h1>Using Cronjobs to run scheduled tasks</h1></header>
    <nav></nav>
    <main>
        <p>
        Cron is a service that lets you run scheduled tasks. These tasks are called <strong> cronjobs. </strong> If you have already followed the initial course you will have already used cron when you set up certbot.
        </p>
        <h2> What tasks would I want to schedule? </h2>
        <p>
        You can schedule anything! Some examples of what you might have done already include:
        <ul>
            <li> <code> updatedb </code> to update your <code> locate </code> database </li>
            <li> <code> certbot </code> to update renewing of your https certs </li>
        </ul>
        Some tasks that you might <em>want</em> to schedule may include:
        <ul>
            <li> Package updates - if you really just want to leave your server alone you can automated updating packages on your server </li>
            <li> Backups - you may want to backup certain files every day and some every week, this is possible with cron </li>
        </ul>
            <p>
            And many more, anything you can do can be turned into a cronjob.
            </p>

            <h2>Basic Cronjobs</h2>

            <p>
            This the preferred method for personal tasks and scripts, it's also the easiest to get started with. Run the command <code> crontab -e </code> to access your users crontab
            </p>

            <p>
            Once you have figured out the command you want to run you need to figure out how often you want to run it and when. I am going to schedule my system updates once a week on at 3:30 AM on a Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
            We now have to convert this time (Every Monday at 3:30 AM) into a cron time. Cron uses a simple but effective way of scheduling when to run things.
            </p>
            <p>
            Crontab expressions look like this <code> * * * * * command-to-run </code>
            The five elements before the command tell when the command is supposed to be run automatically.
            <p>
            So for our Monday at 3:30AM job we would do the following:
            <p>
            <pre><code> .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
 | .------------- hour (0 - 23)
 | | .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
 | | | .------- month (1 - 12
 | | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6)
 | | | | |
 * * * * *
30 3 * * 1 apt -y update && apt -y upgrade</code></pre>

            <h3>Some notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On the day of the week option, Sunday is 0 and counting up from there, Saturday will be 6.</li>
                <li><code>*</code> designates "everything". Our command above has a <code>*</code> in the day of month and month columns. This means it will run regardless of the day of the month or month.</li>
                <li>The hour option uses 24 hour time. 3 = 3AM, while use 15 for 3PM.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>More examples</h3>
            <p>
            Let's add another job, our backup job (for the purposes of this our backup command is just called <code> backup</code>) We want to run <code> backup </code> Every evening at 11PM, once we work out the timings for this we can add the to the same file as the above by running <code> crontab -e </code> This would mean our full crontab would look like this:
            <pre><code>0 23 * * * backup</code></pre>

            <h3>Consecutive times</h3>

            <p>
            Suppose we want a command to run every weekday.
            We know we can put <code>1</code> (Monday), but we can also use <code>1-5</code>
            to signify from day 1 (Monday) to day 5 (Friday).
            </p>

            <pre><code>0 6 * * 1-5 echo "Wakey, wakey, wagie!" >> /home/wagie/alarm</code></pre>

            <p>The above <code>echo</code> command runs every Monday through Friday at 6:00AM.</p>

            <h3>Non-consecutive times</h3>

            <p>
            We can also randomly specify non-consecutive arguments with a comma.
            Suppose you have a script you want to run at the midday of the 1st, 15th, and 20th day of every month.
            You can specify that my putting <code>1,15,20</code> for the day of the month argument:
            </p>

            <pre><code>0 12 1,15,20 * * /usr/bin/pay_bills_script</code></pre>

            <h3>"Every X minutes/days/months"</h3>

            <p>We can also easily run a command very several minutes or months, without specifying the specific times:
            </p>

            <pre><code>*/15 * * * * updatedb</code></pre>

            <p>
            This cronjob will run the <code>updatedb</code> command every 15 minutes.
            </p>

            <h3>Beware of this Rookie Mistake Though...</h3>

            <p>
            Suppose you want to run a script once every other month.
            You might be <em>tempted</em> write this:
            </p>

            <pre><code>* * * */2 *</code></pre>

            <p>
            That might <em>feel right</em>, but this script <em>will be running once every minute during that every other month</em>.
            You should specify the first two arguments, because with <code>*</code> it will be running every minute and hour!
            </p>

            <pre><code>0 0 1 */2 *</code></pre>

            <p>This makes the command run <em>only</em> at 0:00 (12:00AM) on the first day of every two months, which is what we really want.</p>

            <h2>User vs. Root Cronjobs</h2>

            <p>
            It is important to note that user accounts all have different cronjobs.
            If you have a user account <code>chad</code> and edit his crontab with <code>crontab -e</code>,
            the commands you add will be run as the <code>chad</code> user, not <code>root</code> or anyone else.
            </p>

            <p>
            Bear in mind that if you need root access to run a particular command,
            you will usually want to add it as root.
            </p>

            <h2>System-wide cron directories</h2>

            <p>
            <code>crontab -e</code> is the typical interface for adding cronjobs, but it's important to at least know that system-wide jobs are often stored in the file directory.
            Some programs which need cronjobs will automatically install them in the following way.
            </p>

            <p>
            Run the command <code> ls /etc/cron* </code> you should see a list of directories and there contents. The directories should be something like the below
            <ul>
                <li> /etc/cron.d  <em> This is a crontab like the ones that you create with </em> <code> crontab -e </code> </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.hourly </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.daily </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.weekly </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.monthly </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The directories cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} are where you can put <strong> scripts </strong> to run at those times. You don't put normal cron entries here. I prefer to use these directories for system wide jobs that don't relate to an individual user.
            </p>
