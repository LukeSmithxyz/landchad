        <p>
        Using Git to manage your website is honestly the way you should do it, especially if you’re running a small blog or something, but really it can be used to manage any large site.
        </p>
        <p>
        This tutorial assumes you’re running nginx on Debian 10 as that’s what I use, but I think you should be able to get away with Ubuntu or something like that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        So let’s get started.
        </p>

        <h2>The server part of the setup</h2>

        <p>
        SSH into your remote VPS, by now you should have an SSH key set up on your server so you don’t need to use passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
        Login as root into your vps using <code>ssh root@<strong>example.org</strong></code>
        </p>
        <p>
        Make sure you have Git installed on your VPS. If it’s not there yet, install it using <code>apt install git</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This assumes that you already have a website up and running located in your <code>/var/www</code> folder.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once Git is installed, make sure the <code>/var/repo</code> directory exists. If not, create it using <code>mkdir /var/repo</code>. Then cd into it <code>cd /var/repo</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you cd into the folder, create a folder for your website. Note that this is not the directory your site files live in.
        </p>
        <p>
        Make the site directory, for example <em><strong>example.org</strong></em>. I also like to append the <code>.git</code> at the end of the folder, so the command would look like this: <code>mkdir <strong>example.org</strong>.git</code>. However, this directory can be named however you like, I just like to keep things clean and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once the directory is there, cd into it <code>cd <strong>example.org</strong>.git</code>
        </p>
        <p>
        Now cd into the <em>hooks</em> folder and make a new file called <em>post-receive</em>. <code>cd hooks</code> and <code>nano post-receive</code> (or vim if you’re a big brain, but I don’t know how to exit that so…)
        </p>
        <p>
        Now write this into the file:
        </p>
        <p>
        <pre><code>#!/bin/sh
        git --work-tree=/var/www/<strong>example.org</strong> --git-dir=/var/repo/<strong>example.org</strong>.git checkout -f</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        Now make it executable using <code>chmod +x post-receive</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now this part of the setup is done and you can exit out of SSH.
        </p>

        <h2>The local part of the setup</h2>

        <p>
        Now, cd into the folder where you want to manipulate the website files. This can be any folder you choose.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, initialize a repo inside the folder using <code>git init</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have any scripts or any other stuff inside this folder you don’t want to push to the server, just add them into the <em>.gitignore</em> file, one line each.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, let’s add a remote repo it can push to. For this we use <code>git remote add live ssh://<strong>example.org</strong>/var/repo/<strong>example.org</strong>.git</code>. You can name the branch however you want, but I name it <code>live</code> to avoid any confusion.
        <p>
        If you already have some files inside your site folder, you can pull them using <code>git pull live master</code>. Note that <em>live</em> is the remote location and <em>master</em> is the branch on it.
        </p>
        <p>
        This part of the setup is done, now let me show you how to actually use it if you don't know much Git.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use it</h2>

        <p>
        When you make any changes, let’s say to the <em>index.html</em> file, changing the favicon, etc you can add them to commit using <code>git add .</code>. If you don’t want to add all files you changed in some cases, you can just use <code>git add index.html</code> for specific files.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then it helps to see which files were actually added/changed/deleted using <code>git status</code>. It will show you everything you need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now it’s time to commit the changes. Use <code>git commit -m "message"</code>. Note that the message doesn’t really matter unless there’s like a team working on it or something, so just write something there as you can’t unfortunately leave it blank.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you’re ready to deploy the changes to the website, do <code>git push live master</code> to push it directly onto the live website.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can automate all this using a simple shell script, which I definitely recommend you do.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you’ve done everything right, changes you have made should appear instantly on your website. If it’s not there, you probably made a spelling mistake somewhere in the <em>post-receive</em> script.
        </p>
