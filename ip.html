    <nav></nav>
    <main>
	
    	<p>
	Internet Protocol (IP) is how computers and servers comunicate with one another. It is the set of rules our computers use to make sure our data gets to where it needs to be. We will be going over three concepts we use to talk about how two computers might communicate.
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Packets</li>
	    <li>IP Addresses</li>
	    <li>Ports</li>
	</ul>
    
	<p>
	Everything from DNS to Firewalls is set up in terms of Internet Protocol. Understanding this can help you troubleshoot your servers and configure other settings to better fit your needs.
	</p>

        <h2>Packets</h2>
	
	<p>
	Packets are small chunks of data that are sent between computers. You can think of them as letters between computers. You have an envelope with the address it came from and the address its going toand the data is inside. However, unlike letters, computers typically need to send multiple packets to relay the whole message they want to send. For example it would work something like this.
	</p>

	<p>
	Bob sends Charlie a message that says "Hi! How are you?	Bob's computer might send a packet for each word. Then Charlie's computer would reassemble the message for him to see
	</p>

	<p>
	There are multiple different kinds of packets, and they are usually made up of slightly different information based on their type. But, all packets include a destination, where it came from, and the data that is being sent.
	</p>

        <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
	
	<p>
	So next let's learn how to write the address that packets use. They are called IP addresses or IP's for short. An IP is made of four numbers ranging from 0 to 255. Each of them are separated by periods. Each of these numbers are held in 1 byte, and those four bytes make up the IP address. Each computer on the internet has at least one of these addresses. That includes servers for web pages. Another way you could access a webpage is by typing the IP address into the address bar of your browser. For example <code>142.250.138.100</code> is one of the IP's that leads to google.com. If you type that in, it should take you straight to google. 
	</p>

        <h2>Ports</h2>

	<p>
	So one last thing to discuss is ports. Each time you connect to another computer or to a website, you have to use a specific port at their specific IP Address. A port is kind of like a window or door into the computer. Some of these are open. Some are locked. Either way the only way in is through a port. These ports are indicated by a number. For instance, port 80 is usually used when connecting to a webpage.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can write an IP Address/Port pair like this <code>IPAddress:Port</code>. If you wanted to connect to google.com on port 80, you could write it <code>142.250.138.100:80</code>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Common Ports</h3>
	<p>
	For most protocols, we have a standard port to use. For instance, your web browser knows it needs to use port 80 when using http or port 443 when using https. Here is a list of protocols and their standard ports.
	</p>

	<pre><code>
PORT		        PROTOCOL
----			--------
22			SSH		SECURE SHELL
25			SMTP		SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL
42			NAMESERVER	INTERNET NAME SERVICE
80			HTTP		HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
110			POP3		POST OFFICE PROTOCOL VERSION 3
115			SFTP		SECURE FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL
143			IMAP		INTERENT MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL
194			IRC		INTERNET RELAY CHAT
443		    	HTTPS		SECURE HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
	</code></pre>
